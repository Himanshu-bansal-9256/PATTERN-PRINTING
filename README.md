# Pattern Printing in C++

## Description

This repository contains a C++ program (`pattern.cpp`) that demonstrates various pattern-printing techniques. The program includes multiple functions, each responsible for printing a different pattern using loops and conditional statements.

## Features

- Prints different patterns using `*`, numbers, and alphabets.
- Supports user input to select and display specific patterns.
- Well-structured and modularized functions for better readability.

## Patterns Included

The program includes functions to print:

1. Square Star Pattern
2. Right-angled Triangle Pattern
3. Number Pyramid
4. Alphabet Patterns
5. Diamond and Hollow Square Patterns
6. Many more complex variations

## Usage

1. Clone the repository:
   ```sh
   git clone https://github.com/your-username/pattern-printing.git
   ```
2. Navigate to the project folder:
   ```sh
   cd pattern-printing
   ```
3. Compile and run the program:
   ```sh
   g++ pattern.cpp -o pattern && ./pattern
   ```
4. Enter the number of test cases and pattern size as prompted.

## Prerequisites

- C++ Compiler (GCC or Clang recommended)
- Basic understanding of loops and conditional statements in C++

## Example Output

```
Enter number of test cases: 1
Enter pattern size: 5
